# Introduction

The project **“Mimicking the Writing Style of Odysseus Elytis”** is the result of work completed for the course *"Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning II"* at the Physics Department of the University of Crete. 

In this project, we explore three different approaches to mimicking a writing style, using the works of the Nobel Prize-winning Greek poet as our foundation. This project is intended purely for learning purposes and does not aim to achieve anything beyond that at this point.
